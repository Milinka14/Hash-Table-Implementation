This is flexible C++ hash table implementation that separates the core table operations from the collision resolution strategy. It uses an abstract AddressFunction class to allow easy switching between different probing methods like quadratic, linear, or double hashing. This makes it perfect for comparing the performance of different collision resolution techniques, as it includes built-in functions to track efficiency metrics like average access time and collision rates. The table automatically resizes when it becomes too full or when performance drops, ensuring optimal operation. It also supports loading data from files and provides detailed statistics about its performance.
